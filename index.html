            <h1>Hi, I’m Marc</h1>
            <P>..... …and I work for the next generation of makers.

                    Tech is reshaping how we learn and come togethe. Software is
                    ubiquitious and every person can now build their way to a future that 
                    inspires them. However, <b> today’s world isn’t designed 
                    to work for these makers</b> creating an imbalance between the impact they’re capable of, 
                    and what’s expected of them.</P>
            <p>I’m working to solve this problem…</p>
            <ul>
                <li>by creating better <b>tools</b> at <a href="https://sdui.de/"> Sdui</a> for education and formerly
                    at <a href="https://hackerbay.com/">Hackerbay</a>  for <br> hackers and companies;</Li>
                <li>by building <b> communities</b>, formerly
                    as co-founder of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307065333/https:/hackevents.co/">Hackevents</a>  organizing <br> hackathons across Germany,
                now by mentoring at hackathons around the <br> world;</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>…and through one commit at a time.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am working as <b> Head of Engineering</b> at <a href="https://sdui.de/">Sdui</a> . It’s an amazing gig where I get to work alongside great developers on a software product that has become an integral medium upon which tens of thousands of teachers, parents and students
            rely to guarantee essential communication.</p>
            <p>I’m currently <b> living in Helsinki, Finland.</b> Some other places I’ve lived in are Berlin,
            San Francisco, Hong Kong, Toronto, and Munich.</p>
            <p>I’m a huge physics nerd, in particular cosmology. I wrote about the accelerating expansion
            of the universe, or better know as Dark Energy <a href="https://mfts.io/posts/dark-energy">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>Previously</h2>
            <p>I founded and built <a href="https://hackerbay/">Hackerbay</a>as CTO with three 
            awesome friends. We took a small insight from hackathons –<i>software is not a 12 month development cycle</i> – and built up a B2B company. We worked with Twitter, Vodafone, Allianz and some of Germany’s largest corporations. With <a href="https://nfx.com/">NFX</a> we had incredible investors
            on board and always an open ear from James, Pete, or Gigi.</p>
            <p>After five years of immense personal and professional growth, priorities changed and we decided to pursue new opportunities,
            where each of our personal strengths are best put to use.</p>
            <p>For me that’s <b> building tools for
            ..enabling the next billion developers</b>.</p>
